"""
Story:
Once upon a time in Appleland, John had three apples, Mary had five apples,
and Adam had six apples. They were all very happy and lived for a long time. End of story.

Your task is to:

1.0 create the variables: john, mary, and adam;
2.0 assign values to the variables. The values must be equal to
the numbers of fruit possessed by John, Mary, and Adam respectively;
3.0 having stored the numbers in the variables, print the variables on one line,
and separate each of them with a comma;
4.0 now create a new variable named totalApples equal to
addition of the three former variables.
5.0 print the value stored in totalApples to the console;
6.0 experiment with your code: create new variables, assign different values to them,
and perform various arithmetic operations on them (e.g., +, -, *, /, //, etc.).
Try to print a string and an integer together on one line, e.g., "Total number of apples:" and totalApples.
